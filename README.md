# Heap Data Structures: Heapsort and Priority Queue

## Overview

This repository contains Python implementations of:

- **Heapsort**: An in-place comparison-based sorting algorithm using a max-heap.
- **Priority Queue**: A min-heap-based priority queue managing tasks with priorities.

## Files

- `heapsort.py`: Heapsort implementation with `heapify` and `heapsort` functions.
- `task.py`: `Task` class representing a schedulable task with priority, arrival time, and deadline.
- `priority_queue.py`: Priority queue implementation using Pythonâ€™s `heapq` module.
- `main.py`: Demonstration of Heapsort and Priority Queue functionalities.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the source files.
2. Run the main program:

```bash
python main.py
